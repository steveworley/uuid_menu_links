Overview:

The uuid menu links module adds a universally unique identifier field to the
menu links table. The universally unique identifier will allow the menu links
to be exported and tracked regardless of changes to the particular item.

The module is intended to work with the Configuration module to provide a more
transparent and accountable method for tracking menu link configurations.
